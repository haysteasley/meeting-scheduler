Schedule meetings in different time zones!

If you work remotely- maybe you manage a team or need to correspond with an international client or coworker- knowing time zones becomes a necessary criteria when trying to connect. If you have multiple different time zones on one call, search your desired time (now only availabe in Eastern Standard Time) and discover the exact day, hour, and minute the desired time zone will be in. Using Croner, I was able to interact with their program to fetch and receive the accurate data. Enjoy!
